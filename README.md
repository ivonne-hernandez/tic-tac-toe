# [Tic-Tac-Mando](https://github.com/ivonne-hernandez/tic-tac-toe)
Tic-Tac-Mando is an application that allows users to play a Mandalorian-themed game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Users can win by having their tokens fill up a column, row, or diagonal. There can also be a draw. In either case, the game will start over after two seconds. The wins for both players are saved in local storage, so they will persist upon page reload.  

#### How to Use the App:
- Go to [Tic-Tac-Mando](https://github.com/ivonne-hernandez/tic-tac-toe)

- The main page will indicate whose turn it is, starting off with Baby Yoda.

- Once the player selects an open square on the gameboard, the game will check to see if there is a win or draw. If there isn't, then the game will continue by allowing the next player to select a square. 

- If a player has filled up a column, row, or diagonal with their tokens, their win will be displayed, added to their count of wins, and the game will start over. 

- If the gameboard has been filled and no one has won, the game will be drawn and start over.
